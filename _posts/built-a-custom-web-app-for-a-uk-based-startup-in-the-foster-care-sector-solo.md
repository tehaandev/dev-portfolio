Fosterli Ltd. is a startup based in the UK focusing on digitizing the foster care application process, and they needed a secure web application that could handle complex and highly regulated assessments across to-be foster carers and agencies.

The current process relied on large amounts of physical forms ‚Äî leading to data loss, redundancy, and almost no collaboration between applicants and their social workers.

As the sole developer of this web app, I took full ownership of the system design, development, and deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Engineering Challenges

Among the many features we deployed, a few stood out due to their complexity:

- A two-stage assessment, with 6 steps in stage one and 15+ steps in stage two, including conditional (dynamic) sections and repeatable fields (e.g., multiple pets).
- Assignable form fields that allowed users to delegate specific fields to others for completion and submission ‚Äî ensuring the assignee only had access to their designated fields.
- A real-time chat system enabling applicants to communicate with their designated social workers.
- Strict compliance requirements, including GDPR and industry-specific regulations related to handling sensitive data on minors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features Shipped

- Built a flexible system to handle multi-stage assessments (multiple steps each) with repeatable sections (e.g., multiple pets).
- Implemented field assignment logic that allows users to delegate specific form fields to others. Assignees could only view and submit their designated fields ‚Äî no extra access.
- Integrated a live chat system between applicants and their assigned social workers, scoped by role and case ID to maintain strict separation.
- Architected with GDPR and industry-specific compliance in mind, especially around sensitive PII and minor-related data. Used server-side rendering and secure storage patterns to enforce best practices.
- Took complete ownership of dev, infra, and CI/CD ‚Äî using Next.js App Router, Prisma/PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS), GitHub Actions, Docker, and EC2. Also added Sentry for real-time monitoring and alerting.
